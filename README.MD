# Install & Run sample app

Make sure you've got the latest stable node and yarn installed.

Run from project root:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn bootstrap
$ yarn build
```

Then, go to `packages/example-ts-express-react` and create `.env` file from the template:

```bash
$ cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

Then, edit it following recommendations in the comments.

After that, start the server:

(in the same `packages/example-ts-express-react` dir)
```bash
$ yarn start:server 
```

This should start the server on `http://localhost:8080`;
